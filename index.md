# List of my favouride Programming languages.

> some of my favourite programming languages in terms of decreasing priority include the following ...

- Shell Programming language
- C++ Programming languages
- C programming languages
- pyhton programming language

&nbsp; This priority is based on how much i master the language and not of its ease. Because pythhon is defintely a high level programming language and is easier to understand

Programing is the heart of software engineering and it is thanks to programming that the world is advancing at the speed of light .

> If I have an advice for you it should be that you should fear God and Learn a programming language.
